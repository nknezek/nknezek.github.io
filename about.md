This is the personal blog of Nicholas Knezek. I'm currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Earth and Planetary Science at UC Berkeley, working under the advisement of Bruce Buffett. I'm interested in the generation and evolution of Earth's magnetic field, and study it using numerical and statistical methods.
