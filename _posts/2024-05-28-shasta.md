On memorial day Sunday, Dan, Tank, Sam, and I successfully summited and skiied down Mount Shasta (14,179ft / 4,322m) in a one-day push. Dan and Tank were fairly experienced with backcountry skiing, but this was Sam and my first time on backcountry skis. It was also my first time using crampons, an ice axe, summitting a 14er, and the first time I'd ever been above 11k feet. Perhaps most importantly, this was also the first time on skis since I'd torn my ACL skiing last year and was approximately 1 year after my ACL repair surgery. Needless to say, this was a big effort and I was very nervous heading into the weekend.

## Preparation

We drove up Friday after work and checked into our room at the LOGE Mt Shasta. It was an awesome outdoor adventure base, with a mountain bike rental shop, campsites, a communal campfire and kitchen, and a hammock, bike hooks, a ski rack, and free outdoor gear to use in our room!

On Saturday, we woke up and headed to Fifth Season where Sam and I picked up our rental gear. This included a backcountry setup of skis, skins, ski crampons, boots, helmet, poles, boot crampons, and an avalanche beacon. We also borrowed packs, avalanche probes, and shovels from Dan and Tank.

We then headed to Bunny Flats where Dan led a quick tutorial on how to use our equipment and not die on the mountain. We donned our boots and stuck the skins to the bottom of our skis, then headed out up the hill to practice skinning on flats and slopes with the risers. After skiing back down, we switched to crampons and practiced side-stepping and self-arresting with our ice axes. Finally, we discussed avalanche safety and practiced using our beacons to located a "missing" person, probing, then digging them out of the snow. For me, all of this was brand-new and even the skiing felt awkward after a year off skis and using new equipment on icy snow filled with suncups. However, after our 1.5hr crash course of mountaineering skills we headed back to eat, grab supplies, prep our gear, and sleep.

After gathering everything and signing our permits, we all popped melatonin and sleeping pills around 5:30pm in preparation for an 11pm wakeup. We planned to follow the Avalanche Gulch route and skin up as far as we could, then switch the crampons and pack our skis to the summit before skiing down. We estimated that it would take 11-13 hours to summit, and 2-3 hours to ski down. By leaving at midnight, this would put us at the summit around noon and back at the car around 2-3pm.

We all managed to sleep around 5.5 hrs and woke up at 11pm to pack the car. We were on the road by 11:30 and made it to the Bunny Flats trailhead by midnight. The parking lot was absolutely _filled_ for memorial day, which meant I had to drop everyone off and go park a mile down the road. After one last attempt to poop, we were on our skis skinning into the darkness by 12:30am.

## Skinning to Helen Lake
3 mi, +3,490 ft - last 0.1 mi @ 50% grade, took ~4 hrs
Helen Lake, at (10,440 ft) at 4:20am
- Skinning started smoothly from Bunny Flats (6,950 ft) the trail starts at a fairly gentle include through the woods.
- last bit was scary - switched from ski crampons to boot crampons

## Crampons up The Heart
(1 mi, +2,360 ft) to Red Bank (top 12,800 ft at 8:50 am)
- scariest part. Falling rocks and ice. Inexperienced climbers slipped and falling above you. 60% slope and if you slip its 1mi and >2,000 ft down.
- took a rest at a rock 0.2mi and 600ft from the top to regain my strength and confidence.
- took 4.5 hrs
- rested at top.
- stepped over a cravasse - technically a Bergschrund. Tank peed in it!

## Birthday Hill
(+400 ft to 13,200 ft) top at 10:20 am
- after rest at top of Red Banks, went up the small Birthday Hill, which took ~1hr

## Misery Hill
(+640ft to 13,840 ft) top at 11:50 am
- rested at the base of misery hill for a bit
- Dan and Tank sang a song they're re-written to boost our spirits "Misery Hill - that's where I want to ski! (windy windy)"
- I was exhausted, so I told Dan, Tank, Sam to go ahead and leave me with a radio.
- I eventually decided to continue, but left my skis at the base. This turned out to be a great idea! I both didn't have to carry them up and got to walk down Misery hill instead of ski what Dan described as "the worst snow I've ever experienced".
- such a struggle. 5 steps and rest. Howling wind. Blazing sun. Even without a pack it was misery

## Push to the Summit
(+339 ft to 14,179 ft) at 1pm exactly
- At top of Misery Hill, waited for Dan to go use a WAG bag (poop)
- walked through flat area to summit
- last push to summit was surprisingly easy, despite the altitude and more thant 300ft gain.
- another person had brought a can of Shasta cola
- Tank did a headstand on the top, terrifying Sam
- took pictures, wrote in logbook "never again"


## Summit Descent
- I walked back down, telling the group I'd meet them at the bottom of misery hill.
- plunge stepping was surprisingly quick and easy - so nice to be descending

## Waiting at Misery Hill
- got to back to my pack at base of misery hill at 2pm.
- sorted all my gear, prepared my skis, drank some water, ate some food, and began the long wait.
- almost 30min later, Dan and Tank radioed that Sam had lost his phone and had to return to the summit to look for it. The plan was for Sam to take the radio and they would ski down misery hill to me for us to wait for Sam together.
- I then sat for another 30min without hearing anything as Dan and Tank slowly and cautiously picked their way down what they described as "the worst snow they'd ever skiied" - being extra careful not to fall.
- they finally met up with me at 3:10pm
- We were worried about Sam and the snow icing over, so Tank and I decided to ski ahead since we were the weaker skiiers while Dan waited for Sam. Splitting up wasn't ideal, but it was the best option we had at that time as it was getting late and the snow would start to ice later in the day. We decided that Tank and I would ski down to Helen Lake at 10,440 ft so we would at least be near others who were camping, and if we didn't see Dan and Sam by 6pm, we'd ski out to the TH and call SAR on them.
- finally left my long watch at 3:20pm after sitting at the bottom of Misery Hill for almost 1.5 hrs!

## Survival Skiing
- Tank and I started skiing down extra cautiously. Tank had a dead phone and I only had a phone and radio, no garmin, so we knew we couldn't afford any more complications or mistakes.
- I was on skis for the first time in a year since my ACL surgery starting at 13,200 ft and needing to ski 6,250 ft down a mountain to make it back to safety. A bad fall or re-injuring myself wasn't an option.
- We gingerly figured out the way down and did tight turns down birthday hill to the top of Red Banks. Luckily the snow was in great conditions and was soft and fluffy from the sunny spring conditions. Nothing like Misery Hill.
- At the top of Red Banks, we debated for a while whether we should risk walking back across the Bergschrund cravasse on the edge of a steep glacier carrying our skis, or whether we should try to find a safe, ski-able chute between the Red Bluffs. After a lot of debate we skiied down to check out the chutes and found a wide, easy route between the rock towers. Once onto the face of Avalanche Gulch below the Red Banks, we started to enjoy the skiing a bit more, doing wide careful turns across the mountain and making our way towards Helen Lake.
- After about 15min of skiing, during a rest Tank shouted "I see them!" - Sam had managed to find his phone, meet up with Dan, and they were happily skiing down the face of Avalanche Gulch a few hundred feet above us. It was an incredibly relief to see them safe and happy and was so much quicker than we expected.

## Backcountry Bliss
- The rest of the descent down the Avalanche gulch gulleys was pure backcountry skiing bliss. Perfect spring snow in full sun with wide open slopes all to ourselves. 4,000 feet of

## Ski Tracks
- 4:45pm started into ski tracks, at 7,300 ft. Annoying, but still went fairly smoothly and quickly
- back to trailhead at 5pm - around 2 hours later than we planned, but with only minor injuries like chapped lips and blisters and tons of great stories to tell!


I've wanted to climb this mountain for more than 10 years, and it feels great to finally accomplish that goal!
