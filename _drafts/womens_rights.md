Since 2000, attainment rates among 25- to 29-year-olds have generally been higher for females than for males at each education level. Additionally, attainment rates have increased for both female and male 25- to 29-year-olds across all education levels. During this time period, there was no measurable change in the gender gap at the high school completion level, while the gender gaps have widened at the associate's and higher degree levels. Among 25- to 29-year-olds who had completed an associate's or higher degree, the gender gap widened from 5 percentage points in 2000 to 10 percentage points in 2011, but has remained around 9 percentage points in every year since. Similarly, among 25- to 29-year-olds who had completed a bachelor's or higher degree, the gender gap widened from 2 percentage points in 2000 to 8 percentage points in 2009, but the gender gap has remained between 6 and 8 percentage points since 2009. Among 25- to 29-year-olds who had completed a master's or higher degree, the gender gap widened from 1 percentage point in 2000 to 4 percentage points in 2016.
