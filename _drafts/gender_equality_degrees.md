Gender equality in education was steadily increasing during the women's liberation movements of the 1960's and 1970's. Equality has even continued its march of progress when examining Professional and Doctoral degrees all the way through the mid-2000's. 

However, equality in associates, bachelors, and masters peaked in the 1980's and have been in decline since then. Gender equality for associates and bachelors degrees are now lower than in the 1930's. In addition, equality has begun to decline in professional and doctoral degrees since the mid-2000's until today as well. These trends show no sign of reversing and little sign of slowing down.
