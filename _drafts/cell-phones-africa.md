Cell phones are common in Africa, most adults throughout Africa now own at least one ([PEW](http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/04/15/cell-phones-in-africa-communication-lifeline/)).

Africans can use them to get crucial information about crop prices, negotiate business, stay in contact with friends and relatives, and learn about opportunities they would otherwise not be able to take advantage of. Even smartphones are increasingly common, representing about about 1/3 of all cell connections in Africa now and expected to rise to 50% by 2020.

Notably, smartphones open the opportunity for algorithmic micro-loans to people without traditional documentation by looking at the data on their cell phone ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lending-startups-look-at-borrowers-phone-usage-to-assess-creditworthiness-1448933308), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-25/no-credit-history-no-problem-lenders-now-peering-at-phone-data)). While this might represent a privacy concern, that is a small price to pay for access to crucial capital that people would otherwise be denied. In addition, these companies can offer much lower interest rates since no human is involved in the loan approval process.
