## Professional Projects
### [Numerical simulation of magnetohydrodynamic waves]()
 Python and C code to simulate waves in a stratified layer in Earth's core, implemented from scratch using a hybrid finite-volume and Fourier method. 

### [Mars thermal evolution](https://github.com/nknezek/MaTH_CAMPS)
 MATLAB code to track the time-dependent thermal evolution of the Martian core. 

### [Earth thermo-chemical-magnetic evolution](https://github.com/nknezek/MgSi-Exsolution)
 Python package to track the thermo-chemical evolution and coupling between Earth's core and mantle. 

### [Magnetic field observations of Earth's core](https://github.com/nknezek/coremagmodels)
 Python package to work with various published magnetic field models of Earth's core, including CHAOS-6, GUFM1, COV-OBS, and various GUFM-SAT models. 

### [Coupling fluid motions and magnetic signals from Earth's core](https://github.com/nknezek/coreflows)
 Python package to compute generation of magnetic signals due to fluid motions in Earth's core.

## Personal Projects

### [Recipe unit conversions](https://github.com/nknezek/recipe-units)
Python package to convert informal cooking measurements such as *dash*, *pinch*, *smidgen*, or *drop* to standard units and convert between volume and mass measures. 

### [City climate visualizations](https://github.com/nknezek/climatecharts)
Data Visualization of the typical climate of various cities showing temperature and sunlight by hour and average rainfall by day using observed data from weather stations and the [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/) and [GHCN-D](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/global-historical-climatology-network-ghcn) datasets.

### [Global temperature anomalies](https://github.com/nknezek/temperature_anomaly)
Visualization of the global monthly temperature anomaly over time compared to the +2C target set by the Paris Climate Accords using the [HADCRUT4](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut4/) dataset.

### [Location history heatmap](https://github.com/nknezek/location_history_heatmap)
project to track my location every 5 minutes for a year, then visualize as a heat-map and track on Google maps.
