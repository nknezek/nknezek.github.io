## Experience

**Research / Teaching Assistant** (2013 - 2018)   
Department of Earth and Planetary Science, University of California -- Berkeley, CA
* Research: Implemented a novel parallel numerical magnetohydrodynamic model for Earth’s core in Python and C, developed new statistical tests and analysis techniques to study observations of Earth’s magnetic field.
* Courses taught: Physics of Earth and Planetary Interiors, The History and Evolution of Planet Earth, Astronomy – The Planets, Deep Time (Cosmology / Earth History)

**Technologist** (2011 - 2013)    
NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory -- Pasadena, CA    
* Assembled and led a team of six specialists to provide mission assurance and environmental analysis for a $100 million [high-altitude balloon telescope](https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/tasks/showTask.cfm?FuseAction=ShowTask&TaskID=243&tdaID=100050). 
* Implemented monte-carlo particle physics simulation software on supercomputer clusters. 
* Performed dose-depth radiation analysis for future spacecraft missions using a radiation model (NOVICE) and analyzed orbital-debris risk using an orbital debris engineering model (ORDEM). 

**Undergraduate Researcher** (2009 – 2012)

### Professional Projects
* [Numerical simulation of magnetohydrodynamic waves]()
  - Python and C code to simulate waves in a stratified layer in Earth's core, implemented from scratch using a hybrid finite-volume and Fourier method. 

* [Mars thermal evolution](https://github.com/nknezek/MaTH_CAMPS)
  - MATLAB code to track the time-dependent thermal evolution of the Martian core. 

* [Earth thermo-chemical-magnetic evolution](https://github.com/nknezek/MgSi-Exsolution)
  - Python package to track the thermo-chemical evolution and coupling between Earth's core and mantle. 

* [Magnetic field observations of Earth's core](https://github.com/nknezek/coremagmodels)
  - Python package to work with various published magnetic field models of Earth's core, including CHAOS-6, GUFM1, COV-OBS, and various GUFM-SAT models. 

* [Coupling fluid motions and magnetic signals from Earth's core](https://github.com/nknezek/coreflows)
  - Python package to compute generation of magnetic signals due to fluid motions in Earth's core.

### Personal Projects
* [Location history heatmap](https://github.com/nknezek/location_history_heatmap)
  - project to track my location every 5 minutes for a year, then visualize as a heat-map and track on Google maps.
* [Recipe unit conversions](https://github.com/nknezek/recipe-units)
  - Python package to convert informal cooking measurements such as *dash*, *pinch*, *smidgen*, or *drop* to standard units and convert between volume and mass measures. 
* [City climate visualizations](https://github.com/nknezek/climatecharts)
  - Data visualization of the typical climate of various cities showing temperature and sunlight by hour and average rainfall by day using observed data from weather stations and the [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/) and [GHCN-D](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/global-historical-climatology-network-ghcn) datasets.
* [Global temperature anomalies](https://github.com/nknezek/temperature_anomaly)
  - Visualization of the global monthly temperature anomaly over time compared to the +2C target set by the Paris Climate Accords using the [HADCRUT4](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut4/) dataset.
